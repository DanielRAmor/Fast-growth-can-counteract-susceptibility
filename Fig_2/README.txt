Each of the R scripts in this folder generates the corresponding panel in Figure 2 of the Main Text.

Each code includes the main function to solve the model, followed by the list of parameter values. The function "LVAMonod()" corresponds to the version of the Lotka-Volterra model in which the fast grower is subject to an Allee effect. Setting the Allee parameter to zero recovers the version of the model with no Allee effect, used in Figure 2. 

The rest of the code provides the different 'for' loops to run the simulations for each phase diagram.

The last section of the code plots the results.

The raw data and time series plots generating the results summarized in Fig. 2D can be found in the folder for Fig. S7.

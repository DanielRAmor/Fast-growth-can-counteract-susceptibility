This folder contains the codes and raw data to generate Figure 3.

The results summarized in Fig. 3D are obtained by running the code to generate numerical time series (incluided in the folder for Fig. 2, code for Fig 2B) after replacing the parameter values for initial species fraction and dispersal rate by the values indicated in Fig. 3D.

The raw data and codes to generate the results summarized in Fig. 3F are in the folder for Fig. S11.
